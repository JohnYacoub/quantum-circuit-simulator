# Quantum Circuit Simulator

A web application that allows the user to graphically build quantum circuits and view the results on a dashboard. This project combines **React(JavaScript)** frontend with a **Flask(Python)** backend that is the host program to call **Q#** functions to perform quantum operations.

I rewrote the backend logic in JavaScript and you can visit the deployed, fully functional app at https://master.d2fi7ys7p5ku9u.amplifyapp.com/.

Backend source code can be found [here](https://github.com/XandraV/quantum-python-backend/).

## Installation

Clone the master branch and then run the following scripts in the project directory:

- `npm install` - to install relevant dependencies
